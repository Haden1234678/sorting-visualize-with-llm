# Sorting Visualizer with LLM

##  1. Project Overview

###  Objective
To develop an interactive, educational platform that visually simulates sorting algorithms and explains each step using natural language, adapting to the user’s understanding level with the help of a Large Language Model (LLM).

---

##  2. Key Features
-  Visual Sorting Simulations
-  Step-by-Step Narration: Real-time explanations of what’s happening
-  Adaptive Explanations
-  Interactive Controls: Play, pause, reset, adjust speed, algorithm selection
-  Optional Voice Narration: Text-to-speech rendering of LLM-generated content
- Code View: Shows actual pseudocode/JS code alongside animation

## 🤖 4. Role of LLM in the Project

The LLM dynamically generates step-by-step explanations of sorting processes based on real-time algorithm state, user interaction, and selected difficulty level.
